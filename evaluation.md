# Exercise Companion Usability Evaluation Design

## Usability Goals and Senarios:

### User Goal 1
- **Task:** User can sign in
- **Scenario:** Imagine you are a user who seeks to improve their physical fitness, but needs a motivation.  You are told of this application which allows companionship with a virtual pet for whose health and experience mimics your own fitness.  You've just installed the application and need to sign in (using a provided account)
- **Success Condition:** User signs in with provided account

### User Goal 2
- **Task:** User can find step history, pet health, and pet experience
- **Scenario:** Your next task is to find the step history, pet health, and pet experience as quickly as possible.  Note the steps for today and yesterday.  Give a rough percentage approixmation of the pet's health and experience.
- **Success Condition:** User finds the step counter within a minute and denotes the correct step history.  Along with a percentage approximation within 10% for pet health and experience.

### User Goal 3
- **Task:** User user seeks to claim rewards and purchase any item
- **Scenario:** Assuming you've walked a few hundred steps, and wish to give your pet an accessory.  Find a way to gain currency in the tasks menu and find the shop menu to purchase an item.
- **Success Condition:** User claims reward/ currency and is able to purchase a pet or accessory.

### User Goal 4
- **Task:** User wants customize pet

- **Success Condition:** User swaps to a different pet multiple times.

## Vocabulary
- **Health:** Refers to an imaginary health value associated with a pet.  Ideally, it shall go down over time, and increase when the user walks (step counter).  Higher the better.
- **Experience:** Refers to an imaginary experience value associated with a pet which denotes the total amount of walking the user has done with this pet, higher the better
- **Step:** Refers to the steps a user has taken for the step counter.
- **Shop:** Refers to the in-app store for which users may purchase more pets or accessories.
- **Task:** Refers to an optional activity for the user to accomplish.  Upon accomplishment, they recieve a reward.

## User Types

### Script
- We are evaluating the usability of a excercise companion application to determine any fatal usability issues.
- This will not take more than 25 minutes
- Feel free to express your unhinged feelings about this application
- Ask if you have any questions
- Only our team will see this consent form and you may termininate this session at anytime

### Data
- A
  - Device Used: Your Device
  - Goal 1 Observations: User loggined in successfully
  - Goal 2 Observations: User mentioned the dates are too squished and was unable to deduce what they were

  - Goal 4 Observations: User didnt want to customize anymore beyond the top hat (failed)
  - Goal 5 Observations: User switched pets only once (failed), found out his new pet is max experience.
- C
  - Device Used:
  - Goal 1 Observations: User immediately signed in and said woah what is this ui?  Not very compatible (i.e., aspect ratio)
  - Goal 2 Observations: User ignored instructions and just went to customize, user also tried to shake device to test step counter and tap counter, but little did he know, it was not yet implemented.
  - Goal 3 Observations: User purchased items and went through menus, claims he is rich
  - Goal 4 Observations: User said his tamogochi is "dripping" and "your going back to bald"
  - Goal 5 Observations: User is happy at the 7 tomagachis in his collection
- D
  - Device Used: Your Device
  - Goal 1 Observations: Whats the password
  - Goal 2 Observations: Likes the slide up and the graph, although it look like it goes negative
  - Goal 3 Observations: User had to look for an extended amount of time to correlate that claim gives money
  - Goal 4 Observations: User tried all hats
  - Goal 5 Observations: User changed pet once
- E
  - Device Used:
  - Goal 1 Observations: Asked if there was a password
  - Goal 2 Observations: Likes the slide up with thumb, bars are really easy to understand.  Step graph is easy to look at.  Like that the colors pop.  Dates are hard to read.
  - Goal 3 Observations: Some icons are easy to understand while other are not.  Wont walk 20k steps
  - Goal 4 Observations: Likes the character, easy to add onto character.  Would like to push hat up more.

### Results

- Usability Issue 2: Claim button did not indicate what reward was being received.
- Usability Issue 3: Pet selection screen and shop screen was too similar
